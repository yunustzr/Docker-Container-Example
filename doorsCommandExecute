Summary

This article presents three ways to run DXL script under command line and explains the subtle differences among them.
Steps
Supposed you want to run the following DXL code
print("Hello world")

and there is a file called hello.dxl containing the following line
print("Hello world")

There are three ways to run DXL script under command line.
1) Run the codes directly with -D (or -dxl) switch, followed by the DXL codes
Example:
"C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.6\bin\doors.exe" -u username -pass password -D "print(\"Hello world\")"

Note: all " must be escaped, for example, print("Hello world") should be written as print(\"Hello world\")

2) Run the codes in a DXL file with -D (or -dxl) switch and #include statement
Example:
"C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.6\bin\doors.exe" -u username -pass password -D "#include \"C:\\DXL\\test.dxl\""
or
"C:\Program Files\IBM\Rational\DOORS\9.6\bin\doors.exe" -u username -pass password -D "#include \"C:/DXL/test.dxl\""

Note: #include is used for executing DXL codes in a DXL file
Note: \ in a path must be escaped, for example, c:\DXL\test.dxl should be written as c:\\DXL\\test.dxl
Note: / can be used in path to avoid escaping the \ character, for example, c:\DXL\test.dxl can be written as c:/DXL/test.dxl

3) Run the codes in a DXL file with -b (or -batch) switch, followed by the DXL file name
Example:
c:\Program Files\ibm\Rational\DOORS\9.6\bin\doors.exe" -u username -pass password -b hello.dxl
